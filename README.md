# EdX-Data-Science-and-ML-Capstone-Project
In this project, one will answer questions about real-life business problems by using data science techniques.

This course has 6 modules.

One will use following data science techniques to address the four main business problems identified in this project:

Ingest the course datasets.
Explore the datasets and identify the key problem.
Identify and create features to create machine learning models.
Explore various machine learning algorithms to arrive at the best possible machine learning model.

Question 1: What Is the Top Complaint Type?
The goal of this exercise is to find the answer to the Question 1 of the problem statement:
Which type of complaint should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on first?

Question 2: What Areas Should the Agency Focus On?
The goal of this exercise is to do explore the data to find the answer to the Question 2 problem statement:

Should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on any particular set of boroughs, ZIP codes, or street (where the complaints are severe) for the specific type of complaints you identified in response to Question 1?

Question 3: What Is the Relationship between Housing Characteristics and Complaints?
The goal of this exercise is to find the answer to the Question 3 of the problem statement: 

Does the Complaint Type that you identified in response to Question 1 have an obvious relationship with any particular characteristic or characteristic of the Houses?

Question 4: Predict Complaint Types
The goal of this exercise is to do Model Development and Validation to find the answer to the Question 4 of the problem statement:

Can a predictive model be built for future prediction of the possibility of complaints of the specific type that you identified in response to Question 1?

In this exercise, you will use a feature-engineered dataset to determine whether a predictive model can be built to predict the complaint (of the Complaint Type that you decided to focus on in Week 2) by using past data.

Using the best model, you need to predict the number of future complaints (of the Complaint Type that you decided to focus on in Question 1).
